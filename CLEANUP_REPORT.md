# CPA Hex Cleanup Report

## Completed Actions

### 1. Removed Unnecessary Test Dialog Files
The following empty test dialog component files were identified as unused and safely removed:
- `/src/components/ui/test-dialog.tsx`
- `/src/components/ui/minimal-test-dialog.tsx`
- `/src/components/ui/simple-enhanced-dialog.tsx`
- `/src/components/ui/working-enhanced-dialog.tsx`
- `/src/components/ui/simple-client-dialog.tsx`
- `/src/components/ui/nested-dialog.tsx`
- `/src/components/ui/enhanced-client-dialog.tsx`

These files were confirmed to be empty and not referenced anywhere in the codebase.

### 2. Git Repository Setup
The project has been successfully:
- Initialized as a Git repository
- Committed with all project files
- Pushed to GitHub at: https://github.com/harisharnamm/cpahex.git

## Verification
- All required dialog components (such as `confirm-dialog.tsx` used in `IRSNotices.tsx`) remain intact
- Only unused and empty files were removed
- The application's functionality remains unchanged

## Next Steps
- Continue with any additional optimizations for mobile and tablet devices
- Consider implementing automated testing to ensure responsive design works correctly across different screen sizes
- Review and update documentation to reflect the mobile-optimized features
